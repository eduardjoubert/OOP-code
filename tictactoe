#What is the difference between OOP and Procedural coding?
            #OOP coding uses classes and objects where Procedual coding takes on applications by solving problems from the top of the code down
            #to the bottom. Procedural coding consists of a set of steps that gets carried out. Procedures can call upon one another in
            #Procedural code at any given moment. OOP is designed using the consept of objects that interact with the real world.
#How would my program differ if it were made in procedural coding instead?
            #My code would essentially have to be flipped upside down as OOP takes a bottom-up approach when reading code and Procedural
            #coding takes a top to bottom approach.In procedural code the code is divided into small parts called funtions.In OOP the code
            #is divided into small parts called objects.If my code was procedurally orientated it would involve a lot mor calling of
            #functions rather than classes.
#What are the benefits of OOP?
            #An existing class can be extended through Inheritance.
            #Data hiding enables writing secured programs.
            #Multiple instances of an object can be generated to co-exist without any interference.
            #Different modules can be created in the project using objects.
            #It is highly beneficial in solving complex problems.
            #OOP makes it easier to modify and maintain software complexity.
#What are the drawbacks?
            #Programs are bigger as the require more lines of code
            # OOP projects are normally slower than procdure based prgrams as they usually need more guidelines to be executed
            # OOP does not work for a wide range of problems, there are problems that need strategy based style coding to be solved and using
            # OOP to accomplish that will not be affective
